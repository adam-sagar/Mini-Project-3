# Mini-Project-3

Welcome to my Harry Potter database.

Here you can explore a vast collection of wizarding knowledge. This database contains information on wizards, their houses, and the spells they cast.

To get started, simply clone the repository and run it locally. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies, including axios, dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize, if you haven't already. You can do this easily by typing 'npm install (package name)' in the terminal.
